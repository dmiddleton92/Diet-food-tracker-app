                                We created our diet food tracker app with a focused mission: to help individuals easily
                                monitor their calorie and sugar intake. In a world overflowing with information, we
                                recognized the need for a straightforward tool that simplifies dietary tracking without
                                overwhelming users with unnecessary details. By concentrating on calories and sugars,
                                our app empowers users to make informed choices about their nutrition, whether theyâ€™re
                                aiming to lose weight, manage diabetes, or simply lead a healthier lifestyle. We believe
                                that by providing clear insights into these key components, we can support users in
                                achieving their health goals while fostering a balanced relationship with food.

                <h5 class="card-title">About Keto</h5>
                <p class="card-text">The Keto diet is designed to drastically reduce carbohydrate intake, particularly
                    sugars, while emphasizing high-fat and moderate protein consumption. By limiting sugars and overall
                    calories, the body shifts into ketosis, burning fat for energy instead of carbs. This approach helps
                    stabilize blood sugar levels and can lead to effective weight loss. Ultimately, the Keto diet aims
                    to promote a healthier metabolic state while minimizing sugar cravings and hunger.</p>

                <h5 class="card-title">About Mediterranean</h5>
                <p class="card-text">The Mediterranean diet emphasizes whole foods, including fruits, vegetables, whole
                    grains, and healthy fats, while minimizing added sugars and processed calories. This eating pattern
                    promotes balanced meals rich in nutrients, helping to stabilize blood sugar levels and reduce
                    overall calorie intake. With a focus on healthy fats, like olive oil and nuts, it supports heart
                    health and promotes satiety, making it easier to manage weight. By prioritizing natural, unprocessed
                    ingredients, the Mediterranean diet fosters a sustainable and enjoyable approach to healthy eating.

            <div class="card-body">
                <h5 class="card-title">About Vegetarian</h5> 
                <p class="card-text">The vegetarian diet centers on plant-based foods, including fruits, vegetables,
                    whole grains, legumes, nuts, and seeds, while excluding meat and fish. By emphasizing these
                    nutrient-dense options, it naturally tends to lower both calorie and added sugar intake, promoting
                    healthier eating habits. This diet encourages the consumption of fiber-rich foods, which help
                    stabilize blood sugar levels and enhance satiety. Overall, a vegetarian diet can support weight
                    management and overall well-being through its focus on wholesome, minimally processed ingredients.
